<p>My name is Tiana and I am a local hairstylist new to the city of New York I accept all clients but I have rules for everyone who steps into my shop the first one being you have to wear pink or your not getting in second one being in order to get in you need to recite a Nicki Minaj lyric and last but not least you have to be a BARB if not you will be refused service.Here are a few things you need to know about me. I love the color pink, everything I own is pink, my house, my decore, my household items, my phone, my phone case, my car, and even my dog. I have always loved th ecolor pink it doesnt matter the shade. I strated doing hair as a side gig because I originally wanted to be a singer but that changed once I learned how to do my own hair and because of all the compliments I got on my hair and people asking me to do their hair I decided why not give this a try.
