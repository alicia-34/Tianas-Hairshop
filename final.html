	<h1>Enjoy this little music video I put together. </h1>
	<p>Enjoy this little music video I put together of me wearing different Nicki Minaj hairstyles and color in honor of how amazing her hair always looks and dont forget to listen to her new album.
	
	I had a some trouble uploading the final project to youtube, it wouldn't let me upload the vidoe all together alough I thought it was because of the audio i used but when i uploaded the audio sepreatley there was no ploblem. I even tried taking out the pictures that i used online for it but trying to upload it with just the animation and text didn't work either. I am not sure as to why I couldn't upload my final project on to my website directly. I am so sorry but i had to add it into the folder with the rest of my work for the final.</p>
